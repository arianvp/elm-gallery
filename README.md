# elm-gallery
A simple elm-html app with CSS transitions.


Most of the magic happens in `style.css` and in [arianvp/virtual-dom](https://github.com/arianvp/virtual-dom)

## Instalations notes

Because this relies on a version of `virtual-dom` that hasn't been merged upstream yet. You will need to clone [arianvp/virtual-dom](https://github.com/arianvp/virtual-dom)  and [arianvp/elm-html](https://github.com/arianvp/elm-html) and put them in a directory as follows:

    ├── elm-gallery
    ├── elm-html
    └── virtual-dom
